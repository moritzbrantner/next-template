## Canonical runtime

This repository ships a Next.js 16 App Router application at the repo root. `app/` is the only canonical runtime entrypoint for pages and route handlers.

## Runtime boundaries

- Route handlers and pages live in `app/**`.
- App-pack extension data lives behind `AppManifest` in `apps/**`.
- Domain rules live in `src/domain/**`.
- Database access lives in `src/db/**`.
- Cross-cutting HTTP protections live in `src/api/**`.
- Workspace package public APIs are `@moritzbrantner/ui`, `@moritzbrantner/ui/styles.css`, `@moritzbrantner/storytelling`, `@moritzbrantner/storytelling/remotion`, and `@moritzbrantner/storytelling/three`.

## Import rules

- Use canonical aliases only: `@/src/*`, `@/components/*`, `@/lib/*`, `@/i18n/*`, `@/messages/*`, `@/emails/*`, `@/tests/*`.
- Do not introduce `features/`, `stores/`, or `lib/services/` namespaces.
- `src/domain/**` must not import app or component layer modules directly.
- `src/db/**` stays infrastructure-only.
- Foundation-owned code must not import `apps/**` directly except through the manifest loader seam.

## Platform direction

- Keep the deployable Next.js app at the repo root for now.
- Treat `AppManifest` as the public app-pack extension seam in phase 1.
- Promote shared code into real workspace packages before considering an `apps/web` relocation.
