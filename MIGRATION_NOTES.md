# MIGRATION_NOTES.md

## April 16, 2026 platform-repo alignment

The repository now treats Next.js App Router as the only canonical runtime and `packages/*` as first-class Bun workspaces.

## Removed stale runtime leftovers

- older starter-runtime references in canonical docs and decisions
- legacy file-route paths as documented runtime entrypoints
- vendored package tarballs and `.turbo` artifacts under the old `vendor/packages/*` layout

## Current extension seams

- `AppManifest` remains the phase-1 app-pack contract
- `app.manifest.ts` is the standalone repo metadata contract
- `@moritzbrantner/ui` and `@moritzbrantner/storytelling` now resolve from GitHub Packages
- `packages/app-pack` and `packages/app-pack-react` remain the local extension seam

## Result

- Runtime code, docs, tests, and CI now target the same Next.js + Bun platform model.
- Shared runtime packages no longer live as local workspaces in this repo.
- Showcase-owned contract tests live beside the showcase app pack sources under `apps/showcase/**`.
