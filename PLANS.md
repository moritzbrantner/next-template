# PLANS.md

Use this file as the single source of truth for execution plans.

## How to use this file well

- Keep plans **time-bound** and **outcome-focused**.
- Break work into milestones with clear completion criteria.
- Mark status frequently (`not started`, `in progress`, `blocked`, `done`).
- Link each plan item to architecture decisions and tracked tasks.
- Keep old plans for history; archive completed phases instead of deleting context.

## Planning cadence

- Weekly: update milestones and dependencies.
- Daily: update active tasks and blockers.
- End of sprint/release: summarize outcomes and lessons.
