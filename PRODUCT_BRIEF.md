# PRODUCT_BRIEF.md

Use this file to align the team on what this template is, who it serves, and what success means.

## How to use this file well

- Keep it concise and strategic.
- Write in product outcomes, not implementation tasks.
- Revisit when target audience or positioning changes.
- Link to supporting docs (`FEATURES.md`, `PLANS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Product brief template

## 1) Product statement
A comprehensive Next.js template for building impressive, production-ready websites and app experiences with integrated user management, interactive 3D scenes, video components, robust forms, and modern client state management.

## 2) Audience
- Agencies building premium web experiences.
- Startups launching fast with production patterns.
- Product teams needing a polished front-end foundation.

## 3) Problems solved
- Teams start from fragmented boilerplates with inconsistent standards.
- Advanced interactions (3D/video/forms/state/auth) are costly to integrate from scratch.
- Performance/accessibility regressions happen when features are added ad hoc.

## 4) Value proposition
- Opinionated architecture + practical defaults.
- High-impact visuals with maintainable patterns.
- Ready-to-extend foundation for both marketing and authenticated product surfaces.

## 5) Scope guardrails
### In scope
- Next.js App Router conventions.
- Auth/user management starter patterns.
- 3D + video integration examples.
- Form and validation system.
- Zustand state conventions.

### Out of scope (initially)
- Vendor lock-in to a single auth/database provider.
- Highly domain-specific business modules.

## 6) Success metrics
- Setup-to-first-feature time (target: < 30 minutes).
- Lighthouse performance score on starter pages.
- Accessibility baseline (WCAG AA checks passing for starter flows).
- Developer adoption and template reuse.

## 7) Release criteria
- [ ] Core features documented in `FEATURES.md`.
- [ ] Architecture decisions captured in `DECISIONS.md`.
- [ ] Phase plan defined in `PLANS.md`.
- [ ] README includes usage path for new teams.
