# next-template

Next.js App Router template with localized routing, credential auth, account lifecycle flows, MDX + Postgres content foundations, admin/workspace examples, Drizzle/Postgres persistence, and tiered checks.

## Stack

- TanStack Start + TanStack Router
- Next.js App Router + React 19
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Vitest + Playwright
- Tailwind CSS 4
- MDX with repo-managed content roots and DB-backed operational content

## Local setup

1. Copy the environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.e2e.example .env.e2e
```

2. Set at least:

- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `SITE_URL` or `AUTH_URL`
- `DATABASE_URL` for long-lived database flows
- `INTERNAL_CRON_SECRET` if you want the internal cron jobs endpoint

3. Start local development:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` starts an ephemeral Postgres database, applies migrations, seeds baseline users, regenerates `db-schema.json`, and launches the app.

## Long-lived local database

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres mailpit
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:schema:generate
bun run db:seed:test-users
bun run dev:app
```

Run the outbox worker in another shell if you want queued email and announcement jobs processed locally:

```bash
bun run jobs:work
```

## Checks

```bash
bun run checks:nightly
bun run checks:beta
bun run checks:main
```

- `checks:nightly`: lint, typecheck, unit tests
- `checks:beta`: nightly checks plus integration tests
- `checks:main`: beta checks plus database check, production build, and e2e setup/tests

## GitHub Pages build with Unlighthouse

```bash
bun run build:gh-pages
```

This GitHub Pages build now runs in two passes. It first exports the static site with `NEXT_DEPLOY_TARGET=gh-pages`, serves that export locally, runs `unlighthouse-ci` against the exported files, writes `.generated/unlighthouse/ci-result.json`, and then exports the site again so `/en/unlighthouse` and `/de/unlighthouse` are baked into the final static artifact.

The GitHub Actions Pages workflow uses this build path, so the published Pages site includes a static Unlighthouse summary page. `bun run build:staging` is now an alias to the same flow. The generated report directory is ignored by git.

## Seeded users

- `superadmin@example.com` / `superadmin`
- `admin@example.com` / `admin`
- `manager@example.com` / `manager`
- `user@example.com` / `user`
- `alice@example.com` / `alice`
- `bob@example.com` / `bob`
- `casey@example.com` / `casey`
- `dana@example.com` / `dana`
- `private@example.com` / `private`

The seed also creates baseline profiles, follow relationships, notification history, and recent page visits so the test database is immediately useful for social and admin workflows.

## Notes

- Product and architecture docs live beside the app root.
- Example/demo experiences are exposed under localized `/examples/*` routes.
- High-risk HTTP endpoints are protected by shared rate limiting and audit logging.
- Repo-managed site content lives under `content/pages`, `content/blog`, and `content/changelog`.
- Operational content such as announcements, settings, flags, analytics retention, and jobs live in Postgres.
